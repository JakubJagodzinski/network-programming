# Network programming

This repository contains a collection of simple network programming examples written in Python. Each subdirectory demonstrates a distinct concept or pattern in socket-based communication, including TCP servers and clients, multithreading, multiprocessing, and multicast communication.

## Programs
#### tcp_client
  A basic TCP client that connects to a server and sends/receives messages.

#### tcp_server
A simple TCP server that listens for incoming connections and handles client communication sequentially.

#### multithreaded_tcp_server
A multithreaded TCP server that can handle multiple clients at the same time using threading.

#### concurrent_processes
Demonstrates handling concurrent network tasks using Python’s multiprocessing module.

#### multicast
Shows how to use UDP multicast for sending messages to multiple receivers simultaneously.

#### http_server
A minimal HTTP server built using Python sockets to handle basic GET requests.
